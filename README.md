*NOTE: Deployment of ML models has been evolved a lot. At the time this projects is created, there were no(or very little) guidelines for deploying a Pytorch model properly. The methods might be outdated. Use this project only conceptually.*

This project is the implementation of the paper [_Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks_](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

Good news! No need to download any dataset to train. We will backprop over generated image and will use pretrained CNN models.
